Zipper Unzipper is  Java cli based  software  which  is  capable  of  compressing  multiple  files into single Zip file and also decompresses files from Zip file to original files. It uses Oracleâ€™s java.util.zip Package for processing.

Data Compression, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless  compression.  Lossy  compression  reduces  bits  by  removing  unnecessary  or  less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. Zip is an archive format that supports lossless data compression. A .zip file may contain one or more files or directories that have been compressed.
